<p>Constricted access to credit may result in tenant defaults, non-renewals under leases or inability of potential buyers to acquire properties held for sale, thereby affecting our operating results, cash flows, cash available for distribution, and the market price of our securities. A future public health crisis, pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of infectious disease could have a material and adverse effect on our business due to government authorities requiring closure of offices or instituting quarantines of personnel, disruption in global supply and delivery chains, reduced economic activity and demand for real estate, and difficulty accessing debt and equity capital.</p></p>
